# 10 is on the outside. We want all the branches added together to give a multiple of 5.
# The sum would be all the numbers added together, plus the ones on the inside ring
# again. The sum of all the numbers is 55. Thus we need the 5 numbers on the inside to
# add to a multiple of 5. Actually, I don't need computation for this problem. It's very
# straightforward.
